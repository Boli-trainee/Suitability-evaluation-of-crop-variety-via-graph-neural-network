## Abstruct:

With the continuous growth of the global population, insufficient food production has become an urgent problem to be solved in most countries. At present, using artificial intelligence technology to improve suitability between land and crop varieties to increase crop yields has become a consensus among agricultural researchers. However, there are still many problems in existing works, such as limited crop phenotypic data and the poor performance of artificial intelligence models. In this regard, we take maize as an example to collect a large amount of environmental climate and crop phenotypic traits data at multiple experimental sites and construct an extensive dataset. Then, we introduce a graph neural network model to learn crop suitability evaluation and finally achieve a good evaluation effect. The evaluation results of the model can not only provide a reference for expert evaluation but also judge the suitability of the variety to other test trial sites according to the data of the current one, so as to guide future breeding experiments.
